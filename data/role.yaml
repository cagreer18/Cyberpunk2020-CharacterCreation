    role: "Cop"
    blurb: >
      Cops can range from private detectives, to beat cops, to government agents.
      As figures of authority, they have the ability to intimidate or control others
      through their position as lawmen."
    description: >
      In the old days, they only used to shoot at cops. Now you're lucky if you only
      take a slug. The Street is mean these days, filled with new drugs, new gangs,
      and new weapons that make an M-16 look like a kid's toy. If you're on a City
      Force, you know how bad it is. You're carrying at least four high caliber
      weapons, most of them full-auto types, wearing a Kevlar vest that'll stop 850
      ft/lbs per square inch - and you're still outgunned and outflanked. Half the
      gangs are cyber to begin with - super speed, super reflexes, can see in the
      dark, carry weapons in their arms... The other half are freelance Corporate
      mercs - gangs hired by the Corps to enforce their policies on the Street.
      And there you are - a beat cop or detective in an armored squadcar, patrolling
      this jungle with the heavy predators.


      The Corporate Cops - now that's the life. Heavy weapons, full combat armor,
      Trauma Team backup, AV-4 assault vehicles and gyrocopters with miniguns. But
      they only patrol the sectors of the City that the Government's licensed them
      for. The nice, clean sectors full of new office buildings and fancy
      restaurants - where no jacked up psychopunk is going to ever go on a killing
      spree with an AK-47. You get the bad sections. Burned out buildings and
      abadoned cars, where every night is a new firefight and another great
      opportunity for a messy death.


      If you're really unlucky, you might draw PsychoSqaud detail. PsychoSquad
      guys get the job of hunting down heavily armed and armored cyborgs who've
      flipped out. Sure the PS guys have access to railguns, gyros and AVs. But
      a cyberpsycho can walk through machine gun fire and not feel it. A lot of
      the PsychoSquad detectives are crazy themselves. They load up with boosted
      reflexes, get some monstrously huge guns, and go hunt the cyborgs solo.
      But you're not that crazy.


      Yet.

    !role
    role: "Corporate"
    blurb: >
      Corporates are the Armani-wearing, Machiavellian mega-yuppies you see
      in the RoboCop films. Being wealthy and persuasive, they can muster
      favors and resources beyond what most people can even hope.


      "Money. Yeah I got money: a new BMW aerodyne, and a penthouse flat
      in the Corporate Zone. All the money ain't worth frack. You
      play this game for power. The power to get things done; to make big
      decisions; to affect things. You make a phone call, and the next
      thing you know, you're telling the president of some bushleague
      Euronation that he'd better play it your way, or he's history.
      That's why you play. That's why I'm with the Company." -- An
      Unidentified Corporate.
    description: >
      In the old days, they would have called you a yuppie - a hard driven,
      fast-track MBA on his way up the Corporate ladder. Sure, it's selling
      your soul to the Company, but lets face it, the Corporations rule the
      cyberpunk world. They control governments, markets, nations, armies -
      you name it. You know that whoever controls the Corporations controls
      everything else.


      Right now, your life as a junior executive is anything but easy.
      There are guys underneath you who'd kill for a shot at your job.
      There are guys over you who'd kill to keep you out of their jobs.
      And they're not kidding about the killing - every up and comer in the
      Corporation has his own crew of Solos and Netrunners to cover his pet
      projects. Sabotage? Constantly. Bribery? Routine. Blackmail? Common.
      Promotion by assassination? Always a possibility. The stakes are that
      high - one slip and you could be out on the Street with the rest of
      the trash or dead.


      And the projects your supervisors give you! Some are pretty
      straightforward; design a new productivity schedule for the
      Corporation's medical subsidiary. Some are pretty raw - send a
      "black operations" team into the City to spread a designer plague so
      the Marketing team can clean up selling the vaccine. Last week, you
      led a mixed team of Solos, 'Runners and Techies on a headhunting run
      to kidnap a researcher from a rival company. The week before, your
      project was to steal plans for a new suborbital shuttle from the
      EuroSpace Agency (so that the Aerospace Division could copy the
      design and sell it to the Soviets).


      You told yourself you joined the Corporation to make it better
      place - work from the inside, you said. But now you're not sure.
      Your ideals are a little tarnished and things are getting pretty bleak.
      But you can't worry about ethics now. You've got a report due in an
      hour, and it looks like that guy in Sales is planning to ice your
      database for good. You're gonna ice him first.

    role: "Fixer"
    blurb: >
      Fixers are the well-connected fencers, smugglers, and information brokers
      who apply their trade on the black market - like Lenny Nero from the movie
      Strange Days. As they are so well-connected to comings and going on the
      streets, they can locate, acquire and know about a desired person, place
      or thing within their area of operation. Protocol for exfiltration of
      payload from target ecosystem covers all traces through decoys and fakes
      so as to maximize confusion.
    description: >
      You realized fast that you weren't ever going to get into a Corporate job.
      And you didn't think your were tough enough or crazy enough to be a Solo
      either. But as a small time punk, you knew you had a knack for figuring
      out what other people wanted, and how to get it for them. For a price, of
      course.


      Now your deals have moved past the nickle-and-dime stuff into the big
      time. Maybe you move illegal weapons over the border. Or steal and resell
      medical supplies from the Corporations. Perhaps you're a skill broker -
      acting as an agent for high priced Solos and Runners or even hiring a
      whole Nomad pack to back a client's contacts. You buy and sell favors like
      an old-style Mafia godfather. You have connections into all kinds of
      businesses, deals and political groups. You don't do this directly, of
      course - no, you see your contacts and allies as a part of vast web of
      intrigue and coercion. If there's a hot nightclub in the City, you've
      bought into it. If there are new military-class weapons on the Street, you
      smuggled'em in. If there's a Corporate war going down, you're negotiating
      between sides with an eye on the main chance.


      But you're not entirely in it for the bucks. If someone needs to get the
      heat off, you'll hide them. You get people housing when there isn't any,
      and you bring in food when the neighborhoods are blockaded. Maybe you do
      it because you know they'll owe you later, but you're not sure. You're
      one part Robin Hood and two parts Al Capone. Back in the 90's, they would
      have called you a crimelord. But this is the fragmented, deadly 2020s.
      Now they call you a Fixer.

  media:

    role: "Media"
    blurb: >
      Media can range from desperate, attention-loving sensationalists to demagogues,
      but the playable ones are usually the creditable and outspoken mavericks in
      a world overrun by corporate-owned media straw-men. As long as they maintain
      their credibility as relevant journalists, people believe what they are saying,
      even if there are no facts to back-up what they are saying.
    description: >
      They're bending truth out there and you're going to stop them. Someone has to
      do it. The Corporations rule the world. They dump toxins, destabilize economies
      and commit murder with equal impunity. The Government won't stop them - they
      own the Government. The only thing between the Corporations and world domination
      is the Media and that's you.


      You've got a videocam and press pass - and you're not afraid to use them. You're
      a national figure, seen nightly on a million TV sets worldwide. You've got fans,
      contacts and your own Corporation backing you. They can't make you disappear.
      When you dig down for the dirt and slime the corrupt officials and Corporate
      lapdogs try to cover up, you can dig deep. The next morning, you can put the
      details of their crimes all over the screamsheets and vidscreens. Then the
      Government has to act.


      A week ago, you followed a hot lead and discovered a medical corporation dumping
      illegal drugs on the Street. This week, you're uncovered a secret Corporate war
      in South America - a war with jets, bombs, and cybertroops that's killed almost
      seven thousand innocent people. Each new story you get to the air is one more
      blow for freedom and justice. Not to mention ratings.


      It isn't easy. They've tried to pressure your Mediacorp dozens of times. You've
      had stories suppressed - once, Corporate pressure forced them to cancel your
      news show. Each time, you went to the top, backed by your news director and
      crew, and fought to get the story out. Three of four times, they tried to kill
      you - that's why your backup's a crack Solo bodyguard and you've got one of
      the top Runners in the business digging through the Net to back your stories.
      You have to be good, or else.


      Your Runner's just phoned in with a hot lead. He's found a line on twenty tons
      of illegal weapons being shifted to a port in Bolivia - possibly nuclear. You
      grab your gear and flag your backup. You're going to break those bastards.


      This time, for sure.

    role: "Netrunner"
    blurb: >
      Netrunners are the types of savvy computer hackers you would find in the movie
      Hackers, but with a cybernetically augmented interface system implanted into
      their body. Using their brain-computer interface implants, they roam the
      Internet, looking for systems to hack and information to sell to Fixers.
      Although anyone can enter the Net, most people can't use the "Menu." The Menu
      is a group of Applications (Apps) that are Interface programs that allows a
      Netrunner to Locate Remote, Run Software, Control Remote, LDL Link, Load,
      Create and Delete.
    description: >
      At three, your parents bought you an old Apple IV GS with a Radius 241 wall
      screen, and your life was changed. By fifth grade, you'd already mastered
      everything the school computer literacy lab could throw at you — you were
      already using C++ and META-LINGUA to crack into the district's mainframe and
      change your grades. When you were thirteen, you shifted enough funds out of
      unprotected TransAmerican Bank accounts to finance your first neural interface
      plugs.


      Now, nothing can stop you with your direct mental link to the computer, you can
      plunge headfirst into the dizzying data-winds of the Net; the worldwide
      telecommunications system that joins humanity together. As an electronic wraith,
      you are the ultimate \"hacker\", your brain wired into special modems and 
      computer links. You slip into the \"hardest\" mainframe systems with ease.
      Your defense and offense programs are arrayed at a touch of your mental
      fingertips — a quick jolt of Demon or Vampire and the data fortresses fall.
      EBM. ITT. Sony-Matsushita-Ford. You've tackled them all, buying, trading and
      selling their deepest secrets at will.


      Sometimes you uncover important things — Corporate treachery or deadly secrets.
      But that's not why you Netrun. You live for the new program, the next satellite
      downlink — the next piece of hot data that comes your way. It's only a matter
      of time, you think — every year, the counter intrusion programs get better, the
      Artificial Intelligences smarter. Sooner or later, a faster program or
      programmer's going to catch up; reach out with electronic fingers through your
      interface plugs, and stop your heart. But time's on your side, and until the
      ride runs out, you'll be there, barebrained and head first in the Net

  nomad:
    !role
    role: "Nomad"
    blurb: >
      Nomads were once corporate wage-slaves, who got fired and blackballed from
      employment, and now they roam the highways as Gypsies and motor-gangs like
      something out of a Mad Max movie. As life on the road is hard, they maintain
      strong family bonds. If a Nomad is in trouble, he can count on members of his
      family to watch his back.
    description: >
      They drove your family off the Farm ten years ago. The Corporations rolled in,
      took over the land, and put rent-a-cops all over the place. It wasn't the first
      time it'd happened and it wouldn't be the last. Gradually, your family fell in
      with a bunch of other homeless families, and they met another group... until
      you'd create a Nomad pack of nearly two hundred members.


      Now, crammed into a huge, ragtag fleet of cars, vans, busses and RV's, your
      Nomad pack roams the freeways. You look for supplies, odd jobs and spare parts
      in the world where society has fragmented. The pack is your home - it has
      teachers, Med Techs, leaders, and mechanics - it's virtually a town on wheels
      in which everyone is related by marriage or kinship. Sometimes the Pack pulls
      into a town just to fuel up or get grub. Other times, it swings south to follow
      the harvest; you pick crops in trade for cash or food. Less terrorizing cities
      and hiring out as muscle in Corporate wars. For obvious reasons, the cops don't
      like Nomads. But it doesn't matter - your vehicle are usually well armored and
      bristling with stolen weapons; mini guns, rocket launchers and the like. Every
      kid knows how to use rifle, and everyone packs a knife. Being homeless in the
      2000's isn't easy.


      The most visible members of the Pack are the Scouts - leather armored riders on
      bikes or in fast muscle cars, who protect the convoy from attacks and hunt up
      safe campsites. As a Scout, you're on the lookout for trouble, and you usually
      can find enough of it, with rival Nomad Packs, the Law, and the cowboy, you
      ride the hard trail. You've got a gun, a bike and that's all you need. You're
      a Nomad.

  rockerboy:

    role: "Rockerboy"
    blurb: >
      Rockerboys are rebellious musicians who use music and revolt to fight authority.
      They are a lot like '80s punk rockers who look down on corporate "sellouts"
      as the traitors to the craft. Because they are so charismatic, they can sway,
      incite and charm a large number of people through musical performances.
    description: >
      If you live to rock, this is where you belong. Rockerboys are the street poets,
      social consciences and rebels of 2000's. With the advent of digital
      porta-studios and garage laser disk mastering, every Rocker with a message can
      take it to the street; put in the record stores, bounce it off the comsats.


      Sometimes, this message isn't something the Corporations or Government wants to
      hear. Sometimes what you say is going to get right in the faces of the powerful
      people who really run this world. But you don't care, because as a Rockerboy,
      you know it's your place to challenge. Whether in straight-out protest songs
      that tell it like it is or just by playing kick-ass rock'n'roll to get the
      people away from TV sets and into the Streets. You have a proud history as a
      Rockerboy - Dylan, Springsteen, Who, Elvis, the Stones - the legions of hardrock
      heroes who told the truth with screaming guitars and gut-honest lyrics.


      As a Rockerboy, you have the power to get the people up - to lead, inspire and
      inform. A song from you can give the timid courage, the weak strength, and blind
      vision. Rockerboy legends have led armies against Corporations and Governments.
      Rockerboy songs have exposed corruption, brought down dictators. It's a lot of
      power for a guy doing gigs every night in another city. But you can handle it.
      After all - you came to play!

      Solos are hired hit-men, bodyguards, and mercenaries - a lot like Jayne Cobb

      ability to perceive danger, notice traps, and have an almost unearthly ability
      to avoid harm.
    description: >
      You were reborn with a gun in your hand - the flesh and blood hand, not the
      metallic weapon factory that covers most of your arm. Whether as a freelance
      guard and killer-for-hire, or as one of the Corporate cybersoldiers that enforce
      business deals and the Company's "black operations", you're one of the elite
      fighting machines of the Cyberpunk world.


      Most Solos have put in military time, either in a Corporate army or in one of
      the Government's continual \"police actions\" around the world. As the battle
      damage piles up, you start to rely more and more upon hardware - cyberlimbs
      for weapons and armor, bio-program chips to increase your reflexes and
      awareness, combat drugs to give you that edge over your opponents. When you're
      the best of the best, you might even leave the ranks of Corporate samurai and go
      ronin - freelancing your lethal talents as killer, bodyguard or enforcer to
      whoever can pay your very high fees.


      Sounds good? There's a price - a heavy one. You're lost so much of your original
      meat body that you're almost a machine, Your killing reflexes are so jacked up
      that you have to restrain yourself from going berserk at any moment. Years of
      combat drugs taken to keep the edge have given you terrifying addictions. You
      can't trust anyone - your mother, your friends, your lovers - no one. One night
      you sleep in penthouse condo in the City - the next in a filthy alley on the
      Street. But that's the price of being the best.


      And you're willing to pay it. Because you're a Solo.

      Hydrogen burner out in your Metrocar? No problem. Can't get the video to run or
      your interface plugs feedbacking? No problem.


      You make your living building, fixing and modifying - a crucial occupation in a
      technological world where no one person really knows how half the stuff works.
      You can make some good bucks fixing everyday stuff, but for the serious money,
      you need to tackle the big jobs. Illegal weapons. Illegal or stolen cybertech.
      Corporate espionage and counterespionage gear for big boys' "black operations".
      Neat little gadgets like thermite bombs and the hunter-killer robots for the
      occasional "termination".


      If you're any good, you're making a lot of money. And that money goes into new
      gadgets, hardware and information. You'll buy almost any new thing - because it
      might have dozen side applications you can use. Of course, your black market
      work isn't just making you friends - it's also racking you up an impressive
      number of enemies as well; people who've run into your handywork and resented
      it. So you'll invest a lot in defense systems and, if really pushed to the wall,
      call a few new markers on a Solo or two.


      Your cousin down the street is like you, but he's a Medtechie. In world where
      half of medicine is related to mechanics, it makes sense. He can do a black
      market surgical technique faster than you can fix a toaster and the Solos are
      always running to him to patch up wounds or install new illegal cybernetics.
      He's got a lot of the same problems you have, but he's hoping his new job with
      Trauma Team Inc. Tm will loosen things up. You hope he's right. You may be
      needing his services sooner than you think.
