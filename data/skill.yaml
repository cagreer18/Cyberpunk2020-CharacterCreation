    authority:
      !skill
      skill_name: "Authority"
      skill_difficulty: 1
      description: >
        The ability to intimidate or control others through your position as a lawman.
        This attribute represents the Cop's ability to call on the forces of the Law
        and Government to get what he wants. Cops can use Authority to question
        suspects, arrest wrongdoers, and defend innocents. Backed by the power of
        Authority, a cop can arrest, detain, confiscate and enter nearly anywhere, as
        long as he has the proper arrest or search warrants to back his play. However,
        authority is only as good as the guy holding the badge-if the cop appears
        uncertain of his Authority, there's a good chance he'll get nailed by the
        people he's trying to confront. The higher your Authority, the more able you
        are to face down criminals, particularly high level mobsters and officials.
        Authority is applied to your Cool stat.
    charismatic_leadership:
      !skill
      skill_name: "Charismatic Leadership"
      skill_difficulty: 1
      description: >
        This skill allows the Rocker to sway crowds equal to his level 
        squared times 200. This ability (added to your Cool stat) allows the Rockerboy
        to control, incite and charm large number of people through his or her
        performance skills. When under the Rocker's control, this group can easily be
        persuaded to act on his suggestions; for example, a Rocker could convince a
        concert crowd to riot in the streets or attack a heavily fortified police line.
        Charismatic Leadership will only work with groups of ten or more people as it
        is primarily a mob leadership ability. The higher your Charismatic Leadership,
        the larger a crowd you can control and the more direct and complex the
        instructions you can get them to follow. For example, a Level +3 Leadership
        could incite a nightclub crowd to get rowdy. A Level +5 or +6 could provoke a
        concert crowd of thousands to trash a neighborhood, if the area wasn't too
        far from the hall. At Level +9, and higher, you have the same sort of mesmeric
        ability as an Adolph Hitler -- you can raise armies, start movements, and
        destroy nations.

      skill_name: "Combat Sense"

      skill_difficulty: 1
      description: >
        This is the ability to be believed: by your viewers, by the police, by
        important and powerful people. This is critical to getting your story heard
        and acted upon, as well as convincing people to tell you things, give you
        information, or get you into where the story is really happening. The higher
        your Credibility, the more people you can convince, and the easier it is to
        convince high level authorities of the truth of your information. With a level
        +3 Credibility, you can convince most people of minor scandals. With a level
        +5 or +6, you can convince local officials of military atrocities, undercover
        dealings and other front page stuff. At level +9, you can successfully expose
        a scandal of Watergate proportions, or convince the President of the EuroMarket
        Finance Board that aliens are secretly influencing world leaders. Credibility
        applies to your INT stat.
    family:

      description: >

        members of the Nomad's large, extended tribal family. This can be in the
        form of weapons, cash, information, or a small army of relatives. The threat
        of a Nomad family's vengeance may in itself stop harm to the Nomad. The
        higher your Family ability, the more important you are to the Family and the
        more help you can call upon. With a Family status of +2, you might be able
        to get several of the Pack to help you wreck a town, for example. With a
        status of +7 or +8, you are able to make major Pack decisions and lead
        troops. At + 10, you may be the Leader of your Pack. Family is applied to
        your INT Stat.

    jury_rig:

      skill_name: "Jury Rig"
      skill_difficulty: 1
      description: >
        This general repair skill allows the Techie to temporarily repair or alter
        anything for 1 D6 turns per level of skill. This is not a permanent repair;

    medical_tech:
      !skill
      skill_name: "Medical Tech"
      skill_difficulty: 1
      description: >
        This is the skill used to perform major surgery and medical repairs.


        Medical Tech skill assumes that the character has studied medicine in a
        professional setting. This gives him the ability to perform surgery, 
        prescribe drugs, and know the proper treatment of injuries. He can replace
        damaged organs with vatgrown pieces, graft on new limbs, or install
        cyberlimbs. You cannot perform Medical Tech skills on yourself.


        A character with Medical Tech skills makes a check as if using the First Aid
        skill, however, with Medical Tech, the patient will recover at the rate of 1
        point per day. For example, a light wound would be healed in 4 days. A 
        Mortal 3 wound would heal in 28 days. Using Medical Tech skills supersedes
        the use of First Aid skills; a patient on which both have been successfully
        performed regains points at the rate of 1 per day, not 1.5! As with First
        Aid, the patient reagains no points until a successful roll has been made.
        However, second attempts may be made once per day until a successful roll is
        made.

        is used as a persuasion skill, based on the scale of resources requested.
        This could include bodyguards, weapons, vehicles, buildings, money, etc.
        Obviously, the more powerful the Corporate, the more he can call upon at any
        one time. Your level of Resources determines exactly how much you can request
        from the Corporation without overreaching yourself. A Resource ability of +2
        might get you access to a Company car. An ability of +6 might allow you to
        use a Company jet or hire a Solo team from the Corporate Security Division. A
        Resource of +9 would allow you access to almost all levels of the
        Corporation, as well as the ability to requisition almost any Company

      description: >

        (which covers only the cultures and customs of the Street), or Social (which
        covers only what you should do in a given situation), Anthropology covers
        general customs and background of a culture. For example, with Streetwise,
        you know what alleys to avoid and what gangs are dangerous. With Social, you
        know the proper forms of address for a high ranking Japanese zaibatsu head.

        Awareness of +8 or greater, you routinely perform the sorts of deductive
        reasoning seen in the average TV cop show ('The murderer was left handed
        because this knife has a specialized handle'). Sherlock Holmes has a +10
        Awareness. Players without this skill may only use their Intelligence Stat.

      skill_difficulty: -1
      description: >
        This skill covets any type of trained fighting style using hands, feet, or
        specialized 'martial arts' weapons. You must elect a style of martial art and
        take a separate skill for each style (for example, you would have to take
        Karate and Judo separately, spending points for each one.) Difficulty
        modifiers are listed in () next to each skill listed below.


        The primary advantage to martial arts styles is that each one has what are
        called key attacks; attacks that reflect particular strengths of the style.
        When a key attack is used, there is a to-hit bonus based on the attack type
        and martial arts style.


        The second advantage to martial arts styles is that there is a damage bonus on
        attacks equal to the level of the Martial Arts skill; for example, a master
        with a +10 Kung Fu Skill would add 10 points to his damage. This can be a
        formidable advantage, particularly in head strikes (which double damage).
        Martial Arts forms include:


        Aikido (3): This form relies on using the opponent's strength and momentum
        against him. It is a perfect form for stopping an opponent peacefully while
        making yourself very hard to hit. Key attacks are: blocks & parries, dodges,
        throws, holds, escapes, chokes, sweeps, trips & sweets, trips & sweeps,
        grapples.


        Animal Kung Fu (3): These are forms based on animal movements, such as crane,
        mantis, tiger, leopard and dragon forms. These attacks are fast and
        dangerous, with a style that is exciting and flashy. Key attacks include:
        strikes, punches, kicks, blocks & parries, sweeps & trips.


        Boxing (1): The manly art of fisticuffs, this form delivers lightning punches
        and a tight blocking defense. Key attacks are: punches, blocks & parries.


        Capoeria (3): Created by Carribean slaves this form combines dancelike
        movements with fast kicks and low line sweeps & trips.


        Choi Li Fut (3): Descended directly from the ancient Shaolin temples, this
        form combines powerful roundhouse blows and sweeping kicks into a dynamic
        fighting style. Key attacks are: strikes, punches, kicks, blocks & parries,
        dodges, throws, and sweeps & trips.


        Judo (1): This system was designed as a sport form, but is very effective in
        combat as well. It uses throws and sweeps to knock down the opponent. Key
        attacks include: dodges, throws, holds, escapes, sweeps & trips and grappling.


        Karate (2): The Japanese version of kung fu, this style uses straight line
        movements and powerful blows. Variations includ shotokan and kenpo, each with
        their own special moves. Key attacks are: punches, kicks, and blocks &
        parries.


        Tae Kwon Do (3): A very fast and precise form with graceful movements and
        some aerial kicks. Key attacks include: strikes, punches, kicks, block &
        parries, dodges.


        Thai Kick Boxing (4): One of the deadliest forms in existence, this style
        is known for blinding kicks delivered with incredible power. Key moves
        include: strikes, punches, kicks, blocks & parries, and grapples.


        Wrestling (1): This form combines techniques of Olympic and Professional
        wrestling. The style uses a wide variety of throws and holds to incapacitate
        the opponent. Key attacks include: throws, holds, escapes, chokes, sweeps,
        trips, and grapples.
