 * A weapon used specifically in the tabletop rpg Cyberpunk 2020 series. This
 * weapon has special properties such as: Reliability, Concealability, and
 * Availablity. The reliability represents the likelihood a weapon is to
 * malfunction upon use. Concealability represents the ease in which a weapon
 * can be hidden. Availability represents the likelihood that a weapon will be
 * found on the market. These weapons can also be modified through the use of
 * attachments as well.
